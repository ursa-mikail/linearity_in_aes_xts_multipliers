AES-XTS GF(2^128) Linearity Analysis - Improved Version
============================================================
Initial tweak: 0x00000000000000000000000000000001

Generating tweak sequence...
Analyzing linear dependencies...

Analyzing Hamming weights...


Detailed Analysis Results:
========================================
Total tweaks generated: 100,000

Linear Pattern Evidence:
1. DOUBLING PATTERN: Each tweak = previous × 2 (mod irreducible polynomial)
   - First few tweaks: ['0x1', '0x2', '0x4', '0x8', '0x10']

2. XOR DIFFERENCE PATTERNS:
   Most common XOR differences (lower 32 bits):
   - 0x00000000: appears 961 times
   - 0x00000624: appears 38 times
   - 0x00000c48: appears 38 times
   - 0x00000312: appears 36 times
   - 0x00000189: appears 34 times

3. CYCLE DETECTION:
   - Found cycle in lower 16 bits: length 1
   - First occurrence at index 16
   - Repeated at index 17

4. HAMMING WEIGHT ANALYSIS:
   - Mean Hamming weight: 40.32 (should be ~64)
   - Standard deviation: 20.07
   - WARNING: Significant deviation from expected 64!

5. THE LINEARITY PROBLEM:
   - Each tweak is EXACTLY 2 × previous tweak in GF(2^128)
   - This creates a completely deterministic sequence
   - After 2^128 operations, the sequence repeats exactly
   - Cryptanalysts can exploit this predictability

Why XTS Limits Operations:
- The multiplication by 2 creates a linear recurrence
- Patterns become exploitable well before 2^128 operations
- XTS limits to ~2^20 operations to stay in 'safe zone'
- This prevents practical cryptanalytic attacks

Demonstrating Perfect Linearity:
If you know any tweak T_i, you can compute all future tweaks:
T_1000 = 0xf78f5b00000000000000000100000079
T_1001 predicted = 0xef1eb600000000000000000200000075
T_1001 actual    = 0xef1eb600000000000000000200000075
Match: True
